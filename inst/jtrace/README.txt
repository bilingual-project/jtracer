To start jTRACE

Windows: double-click jTRACE.bat  
Mac: double-click jTRACE.sh  
 
If this doesn’t work, open a command/terminal window, navigate to the jTRACE folder (this folder) and enter: “java –jar jtrace.jar”.
 jTRACE will run on any computer platform with Java.  Most computers have this pre-installed.  If your Java is out of date, you can update it at http://java.com/en/download/. You might try running your computer's auto-updater first.
