<H2><A NAME="introduction"></A>About jTRACE</H2>
<P>TRACE is a highly influential model of spoken word recognition,
created by McClelland and Elman (1986). The original implementation
of that model, which we call “cTRACE,” was used to run dozens of
simulations comparing TRACE's behavior with results from experimental
studies with human subjects. TRACE's behavior accounted for human behavior
in a number of important ways, and it is still frequently cited as
the canonical interactive-activation model of word recognition. 
</P>
<P>Although TRACE remains highly important, its original
implementation, cTRACE, is very difficult to use and even more
difficult to extend. For that reason, we have created jTRACE, a
re-implementation of the TRACE model in the cross-platform Java
language, with a graphical user interface and a number of powerful
tools allowing researchers to perform simulations with TRACE easily
and flexibly.</P>
<P>For additional information, see the <A HREF="#references">References</A>

<H2>How to use jTRACE</H2>
<P>jTRACE has <it>simulations</it>, analogous to documents in a
word processor. Up to 20 simulations may be active at any one time.
Each simulation contains three panels, <it>Parameters</it>, <it>Simulation</it>, and
<it>Graphing</it>. The Parameters panel is used to change the parameters of
that simulation. Simulation is used to run and visualize the
simulation. Graphing is used to analyze model activations over time.
In addition to the simulation windows, the Scripting window can be
used to create and run batches of simulations.</P>

<A NAME="phonemes panel"></A>
<H3>Phonemes panel</H3>
<P>The phonemes panel permits editing of the phoneme specifications that 
TRACE uses while processing pseudo-speech.  The simulation possibles enabled
by this panel have scarsely been explored by researchers (as of 07/2007).
</P>
<P>
Working from top-down and left to right, let's review the interface elements.
First is the phoneme specification table, where the actual phoneme feature
values are edited. Next is the duration scalar table, which modifies the temporal
extent of the phoneme being edited.  The allophonic relations table permits the
user to tell TRACE that a pair of phonemes should not compete with eachother during
phoneme processing.  On the lower left, there is a list of languages and buttons
for managing languages.  On the lower right is the phoneme list and button for
managing phonemes; the phoneme that's selected in the list has it's values 
displayed in the tables above.  
</P>
<H4>Work flow in the phoneme panel</H4>
<P>When the phoneme panel is opened, jTRACE retrieves all 'languages' stored in
memory, and those saved to files in the jTRACE/phonology directory.  A 'language',
for the purposes of this section is defined as a set phoneme definitions. The 
languages are loaded to the language list (lower left); the first one is selected
usually 'default') and its set of phonemes are then loaded to the phoneme list 
(lower right); the first phoneme in the list is selected, and the specifications 
for that phoneme are then loaded into the tables above.  The specifications of the 
phoneme can then be edited by selecting a cell in a table and changing it's value.
As soon as a cell's value has been changed, the simulation will reflect the change
(there is no other step to affect the change).  By selecting other items
in the phoneme list, you can browse the phoneme defintions.  By selecting other
languages, their phoneme lists are loaded, etc.</P>
<P>
The phoneme panel is usually used to modify a current language, or to create a new
language definition.  To create a new language, the + button next to the language 
list will create an empty phoneme set, or the duplicate button will copy the currently
selected language.  In either case, you'll be prompted to name the new language, and 
this name will then appear in the list.  Once you have your language selected in the
list, you'll start working with the phonemes.  
</P>
<P>
The save and load buttons next to the language list save and
load complete language definitions (with no other parameters included).  It is
good practice to save langauges to the jTRACE/phonology folder.  Then, the next 
time you open jTRACE, these will automatically appear in the list.
</P>
<h4>Working with phonemes</h4>
<P>
There are four buttons for managing phonemes.  The + and - buttons create and delete 
phonemes from the list.  The rename button prompts the user to give a new phoneme symbol 
while the specifications do not change.  The duplicate button copies a phoneme
specification and prompts for a new symbol.      
</P>
<h5>Phoneme specification - Feature values</h5>
<P>
Once you are ready to start modifying a phoneme specification, select it and the 
details will appear in the tables above.  The phoneme specification consists of
feature values, duration scalars, and allophone relations.  The feature values
(the only part that existed in the original TRACE) consist of seven feature vectors,
each with nine dimensions.  Each of the seven features is named for a phonetic or
acoustic feature.  Whereas such features are typically binary for phoneticians, in
TRACE they are represented by a set of nine numbers, each ranging from 0 to 1.
This allows for greater detail in specifying a phoneme, and permits the spreading 
of the features in time, to approximate speech extended over time.  The seven features 
are BURst, VOIcing, CONsonantal, Acuteness (GRD), DIFfuseness, VOCalic, POWer.   
There are no firmly established methods for defining this phonetic space.
A description of how McClelland and Elman (1986) defined their phonemes can 
be found starting on page 14 of the TRACE paper.
</P>
<h5>Phoneme specification - Duration scalar</h5>
<P>
The effect of duration scaling is to 
increase or decrease the amount that the phoneme is spread out in time.  In the simulation 
panel, temporal extent is represented on the x-axis, so changing the duration scale will
spread the phoneme out longer or shorter on that dimension.  The scalar may range from 0.0 to
2.0, where 1.0 specifies the normal unscaled duration.  This parameter is 
called duration <i>scale</i> because the duration is scaled relative to the feature
spread values.  By default, all of the seven phoneme features have a spread value of
6, meaning they will ramp on for 6 time slices then ramp off for 6 times slices.
Increasing the duration scale from 1.0 to 1.5 will cause the features to ramp on for 
(1.5*6=) 9 time slices and off for 9.   At this stage of development, the values in the 
duration table a locked to one another, so editing one value will change them all. 
The effect of duration scaling on speech perception simulations has not yet been 
thoroughly evaluated.   
</P>
<h5>Phoneme specification - Allophonic relations</h5>
<P>
The effect of the allophonic relations table is to suppress phoneme inhibition between
two phonemes that you'd want to consider to be allophones.  At each cycle of processing
TRACE runs a phoneme competition algorithm, which causes phonemes to inhibit eachother.
The outcome is that the most active phonemes inhibit less active phonemes that are 
alligned with it in time, i.e. on the x-axis.  As an example, let's say that in the
default phoneme set, in addition to the /a/ phoneme we add a duplicate phoneme called
/@/, and set /@/ to be duration scaled by a factor of 2.0.  We now have two identical
vowel phonemes, where one is longer than the other.  One might suggest that these two
phonemes are actually allophones, and so should not compete with one another in TRACE.
To implement that suggesting, check the appropriate box in the table.  Whether this
notion of allophony in TRACE is representative of human speech perception is an 
unanswered empirical question.  Indeed, the effect of the allophony relation is 
extremely subtle, and may only be detectable in sophisticated simulations
designed to highlight the effect.
</P>
<h5>A tip for visualizing phoneme work</h5>
<P>
As you make changes to the phoneme specification, 
if you'd like to see the consequences on a simulation, the simplest thing to do is to 
switch over to the input panel tab.  Once there, set up an input string containing 
the phoneme(s) that you are working on, preferably bordered by silence phonemes, 
i.e. the dash symbol.  The input visualizer at the bottom of the panel will provide
some visual feedback.  For more visual feedbaack, run the simulation.
</P>

<H4>head</H4>
<P>.</P>
<A NAME="input panel"></A>
<H3>Input panel</H3>
<P>The input panel allows the user to design the input segment by segment.
A visualization area shows what the pseudo-spectral input will look when the 
simulation is run.  While all of the options in this panel can also be modified 
from the parameters panel, the input panel is useful for beginning users to
learn about the input options, and for all users to gain insight into the finer
details about the stimuli that they are designing for their simulations.</P>
<H4>Work flow in the input panel</H4>
<P>Work in the input panel proceeds, roughly, from top to bottom.
At the top of the panel is a table of one row in which each segment of the 
input string is assigned to a cell.  By highlighting a cell, it's specifications
are passed into the tabbed area immediately below.  There are three tabs labeled
<i>normal</i>, <i>ambiguous</i>, and <i>spliced</i>, each for specifying a 
particular type of input segment.  Selecting a tab and setting interface
elements will automatically update the selected segment in the table.
In turn, changes made in the input panel are automatically reflected in
the parameters panel and elsewhere.  All changes to the input specification
are reflected in the visualizer window, at the bottom of the screen.  This gives
a preview of the pseudo-spectral representation formed by the input.
</P>
<h5>What each of the three tabs does</h5>
<P>
In the <i>normal</i> tab, select a phoneme from a drop-down list to insert
    that segment into the input string.  In the <i>ambiguous</i> tab, choose
    a <i>from</i> segment, a <i>to</i> segment, and the number of <i>steps</i>,
    to create a phoneme continuum (all with drop-down lists); then, select a
    particular element from the continuum to insert that ambiguous segment into
    the input specification.  In the <i>spliced</i> tab chose the <i>first</i> and 
    <i>second</i> phonemes, and a value for the position of the splice.  The result
    will be a segment in which the first phoneme extends for that many time slices,
    then suddenly switches to the other phoneme, as though the two sounds were
    artificially edited together using audio waveform software.  Spliced input
    is traditionally used in 'sub-categorical mismatch' simulations (cf. Marslen-Wilson
    and Warren, 1994; Magnuson, Dahan and Tanenhaus, 2001; Dahan, Magnuson, Tanenhaus,
    Hogan, 2001).    
</P>
<h5>Input parameters</h5>
<P>A handful of TRACE parameters directly effect how the input specification will
be realized.  These are made available in a table.  Modifying these parameters
will result in changes in the input visualizer below.</P>
<h5>Tip</h5>
<P>Use of the input panel is basically redundant, in that the same changes can
be made in the parameters panel.  Once you understand how the input specifications
work, these settings can simply be typed into the parameters panel, instead of using 
the more elaborate interface here.</P>
<P>.</P>
<A NAME="parameters panel"></A>
<H3>
Parameters panel</H3>
<P>The parameters panel allows various parameters of the model to be
set. In the upper left hand corner, the TRACE lexicon can be
specified. In the upper-right is the model's input. Below is a table
with the other parameters of TRACE.</P>
<H4>Lexicon</H4>
<P>Use the + and - buttons to add and delete lexical
items.  You can delete multiple items by holding the shift key, or
dragging with the mouse.</P>
<P>The lexicon table has six columns: lexical item, frequency, priming,
label, # cohorts[1], and # cohorts[2].  The lexical item is the main
identity of the word in the lexicon - it's phonological make-up.  
When editing these entries the table validates your entries to ensure
that illegal entries are not used.  The frequency is lexical frequency
that by default has no effect, but can be turned on in the parameters 
table.  The priming score causes a priming to affect that words 
processing; by default it is off, but can be turned on with parameters.
Note that the three different algorithms for implementing frequency and 
priming are identical.  The label value allows groups of words to be 
assigned here, to be used in scripting.  For example, you could assign
the labels set1, set2, set3 to various words, and then tells scripting
to do the same operations to all members of a group.  This feature is not 
yet implemented in scripting, but is coming soon.</P>
<P>
The last two columns of the lexicon table cannot be edited by the user,
but are present for informational purposes.  # cohorts[1] indicates how many
other words start with the same letter as the word in that row.  For example,
if 'bark' shows '22 (b)', this means there are 22 words that start with /b/.
Similarly, # cohorts[2] indicates how many words start with the same two phoneme
combination.  'bark' with '7 (ba)' means there are 7 other /ba/ words.
These columns are useful when designing lexicons because the greatest amount
of lexical competition occurs between cohorts, that is, words that overlap
initially.
</P>
<P>
The lexicon table can be sorted according to any of the six columns.
Click the cloumn header to trigger ascending sorting, and click again for
descending sort.  The sorter turns out to be case-sensitive, so all words
starting with capital letters come before any with lower-case letters. 
</P>
<P>The Load button allows lexicons to be loaded from
files. A selection of lexicons are made available with jTRACE, in the
jTRACE/lexicons subdirectory.  The save button saves the lexicon to a
file.  It is good practice to save lexicons to the lexicons folder.</P>
<H4>Model input</H4>
<P>Enter the input string in the box. To specify an intermediate
phonetic form, click the Enable Continuum box. Then specify the
endpoints of the continuum and the number of steps. For example, if
you create a continuum from “p” to “b” in 5 steps, then the
numeral “0” now represents a “p”, “4” represents a “b”,
and “2” represents a phoneme exactly in between the two.</P>

	represents the past, present, and (predicted) future of a perception
	– input at time-step 20 can influence representations before and
	after time-step 20 at various levels. Feature Activations show the

	jTRACE implements five ways of selecting which time step to use to
	plot a word/phoneme's activation. Recall that the X-axis of these
	graphs represent input time-steps. However, TRACE represents the
	past, present, and future in terms of time slices. The <I>specified
	alignment </I>option aligns the words/phonemes to a particular time
	slice (location on the X axis of the phoneme and word graph of the
	simulation panel). The <I>average activations</I> option uses the
	average activation of each word or phoneme over all time slices. The
	<I>maximal alignment (post-hoc) </I>option finds the maximal value
	of each word or phoneme over <I>all</I> time slices, and uses <I>that</I>
	value. The <I>maximal alignment (ad-hoc)</I> option finds the
	maximal value of each word or phoneme on <I>each</I> time slice, and
	uses <I>those</I> values. The Fraunfelder and Peeter (1988) rule
	uses the maximum activations on time slices 4 and 5. (It also
	changes the behavior of the Luce choice rule – see the original
	citation for details.) 
	</DD><DT>
	Luce Choice</DT><DD>
	When the <I>All Items</I> option is selected, all possible lexical
	items in the set of possible responses, including the null response
	(“-”), are used in the denominator of the calculation. The
	F<I>orced Choice </I>option includes only the items you have chosen
	to graph. The exponent in the Luce choice rule is typically notated
	as <I>k</I>, and may be set here.</DD>
        <DD>
        Note that item selection is not applicable to the competition index
        content type, and has no effect on it.</DD></DL>
        <DT>
        Global Competition Index</DT><DD>
        The last section of the analysis panel provides two options relating
        to the graphing of the competition index.  When competition index is
        selected in the content type, jTRACE sums the total amount of competition
        acting within the word (or phoneme) layer at the current time cycle. 
        When Raw is selected from the drop-down, that summed value is plotted
        directly.  When First-Derivative is selected, a slope regression operation
        is applied to the competition data to determine the rate of change of
        competition over time; this is plotted.  If Second-Derivative is selected,
        the slope regression is applied twice, first to the raw data, then to
        the First-Derivative, approximating the accelaration of competition.
        The calculation of slope is done with this equation:</DD><DD>
            b = SUM[(x-avg(x))(y-avg(y))] / SUM[(x-avg(x))^2]
        </DD>
        <DD>
            where <i>x</i> is the time axis, simply incrementing from 1 to the
            number of cycles in the simulation.  And <i>y</i> is the competition
            value.  Because the slope equation requires averaging over a range
            of values, in order to approximate the slope within that range of 
            values, we must decide the width of that range.  I.e. how much of the
            curve should we try to approximate at a time.  The numeric parameter
            labeled 'sample width' sets that value.  Larger values here will lead
            to smoother slope curves.

<A NAME="Scripting panel"></A><A NAME="Scripting panel"></A>
Scripting panel</H3>
<P>The scripting panel allows users to automate preparation, running and analysis of
groups of simulations.  For example, one might ask : "to what extent is the lexical 
effect on phoneme activation contingent on inhibition at the phoneme layer?"   
In scripting, you can run the same simulation 10 times with 10 different
Gamma.P (phoneme inhibition) values, then generate a graph analysis for each 
that focusses in on the relevant perceptual effect; then save each of those graphs to 
images.   By viewing those images, an answer to the above question might emerge. 
That would be a very simple script, and this section of the manual describes the
components of scripts of varying complexity.</P>
<H4>The Scripting Tree</H4> 
<P>
In what follows, there will be references to the "scripting tree" and to
"nodes" in the tree.  A jTRACE script is composed of structural elements (nodes) that 
have specific hierarchical and recursive relations to one another.  There are four 
categories of elements: iterators, conditionals, actions, and primitive values.
In addition, each of these categories has sub-categories.  The user decides how these 
elements are designed, ordered and embedded within one another.  The resulting configuration 
is the scripting tree.  It all sounds pretty complicated, but by working from the
templates that are built-in, scripting is mostly straight-forward.

        </p><p>To see detailed information
        about each node, simply left-click it and its specifications will appear in the
        main window (right). By right-clicking a node, you can delete the current
        node, copy the node to the bottom of the list, or copy the contents
        of the node to be pasted into another node (this feature only works under 
        particular circumstances). </DD>

        <DD>When nodes are selected, the user supplies the majority of the script

        are directed to the script element specification table below for details about
        each element.</DD>
        <DD>Important note: many scripting elements take as their argument(s) an 
        unbounded list of other elements.  Scripting elements that take lists include
        iterators, conditionals, the specify-watch-items action and the write-to-a-file 
        action.  To cycle between elements of these lists a white box appears at the
        top of the scripting window.  Click on the black and white rows in this box
        to select items in the list.  At the right of this box are add, copy and delete
        buttons, which relate specifically to the currently selected list.</DD>

<A NAME="Scripting panel|templates"></A><H4>Scripting Templates</H4> 

The scripting templates can be loaded from the drop-down box in the scripting panel, 
They are the easiest way to start scripting because most of the work is already done. 
Each template lends itself to different applications, iterating over parameters in different ways, 
and generating different kinds of data files.  The set of templates cover many of the most useful
features available with scripting.  Here is a short description of each template.
<UL>
<LI><B>basic-template.jt</B><P>
This is the default template.  It iterates over a selected parameter, from one 
value to another.  The input to the model is always the default input, ^br^pt.  
At each step in the iteration, the script opens a new jTRACE window.
</P></LI>
<LI><B>lexical-iterator.jt</B><P>
Iterate over the current lexicon.  By default, do nothing at each step.
</P></LI>
<LI><B>eye-tracking-and-graph-averaging</B><P>
Dahan et. al (2001) model eye-tracking data.
To do this, they implement feedback in the TRACE model.
They use the forced-choice in the LCR calculation.
And they average over the results of a set of simulations.
This template demonstrates how to do an eye-tracking simulation
and average over the results.
</P></LI>
<LI><B>noise-and-predicate-iterator</B><P>
First, uses a series of actions to create some standard analysis
settings.  Then uses a predicate iterator to iteratively add input
noise to a simulation (in increments of 0.2) until the target item 
no longer exceeds a  certain responce probability threshold (0.6).  
Then stops. Saves a graph image for each simulation until the 
iterator stops.  This template also demonstrates how to create
a dynamic graph title using a combination of text and queries in 
the set-graph-title action.
</P></LI>
<LI><B>contribution-of-feedback</B><P>
Demonstrates a basic usage of the decision rule report.
Run simulations for all items in a lexicon at two levels
of lexical-to-phoneme feedback (0.0, 0.03) and generate
a decision rule report for each sim.  The results (which
must be analyzed externally) reveal whether feedback helps
or hinders accuracy and recognition time.  This methodology is 
used by Magnuson et al. (2005).
</P></LI>
<LI><B>2D-parameter-space-and-lexical-iterator</B><P>
This template demonstrates how to do a 2-dimensional
exploration of the TRACE parameter space, and assess the
results using the decision rule report.  Basically, we iterate
over two parameters and then over every word in a lexicon at each
point in the parameter space.  The decision rule result (which must be 
analyzed externally) reveal total accuracy and average recognition 
time at each point in parameter space.  This methodology is used
by Magnuson et al. (2005).
</P></LI>
<LI><B>word-pair-segmentation</B><P>
This template replicates a simulation from McClelland & Elman (1986).
Starting from the slex lexicon, 213 word pairs were randomly selected.
These were saved to a new lexicon, slex_pairs.jt.  So if ^slip and bar
are two words in slex that were randomly paired, the entry in slex_pairs
would apprear as "-^slipbar-", with silence at the edges but no pause in
between words.  This script attempt to parse 213 such word pairs.</P>
<p>
A lexical iterator iterates over the elements of the slex_pairs
lexicon, as loaded from a file.  For each iteration, analysis 
settings are given, including the MAX-ADHOC type.  Then, the 
write-to-a-file action is used to save a line of text to the 
specified file for each simulation in the iterator.  
For each simulation, the following is saved:<br>
input:  <i>input-string</i>  parse:  <i>top-1st-peak</i>  <i>top-2nd-peak</i>  <i>top-3rd-peak</i><br>
</p>
<p>The 'peak' refers to the <i>item-with-nth-highest-peak</i> query. 
This query creates the specified analysis (graph) then sorts
items by their peaks and returns the one asked for by the user.
Because there is a silence item in the slex lexicon which always
becomes highly active, we ask for the top 3 items.  If the other
two top items written to the file make a correct parse, then
TRACE has successfully segmented the word pair.  Running this 
template reveals that TRACE does very well, and the mistakes
it does make are due to coarticulation or multiple correct
interpretations.  See McClelland & Elman (1986) for more 
about this.
</p>
</P></LI>
<LI><B>your-templates-here!</B><P>
Simply save a script file to the jTRACE/templates directory
and the next time you start jTRACE, your template will 
appear in the templates drop down list.

<A NAME="Scripting panel|tips"></A><H4>Suggestions for effective use of scripting.</H4> 
<p></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Focus on the modeling problem</p>   
    <ul>
    <li>What is research question?</li>
    <li>To answer this, what perceptual effect you are attempting to demonstrate?  Can it be broken down into smaller pieces?</li>
    <li>What is the minimal grouping of simulations that will demonstrate that effect?</li>
    <li>How will those simulations be analyzed to come up with a simple result?</li>
    <li>How can the latter two points be turned into a jTRACE script?</li>
    <li>Once a script has been created: Does it work?  Can it be simplified?</li>
    <li>Do the results convincingly address the research question?</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Analysis settings<p>
When generating Graph images or exporting graph data, a small mistake in setting
graph parameters will lead to frustration.  Be confident about the type of analysis
you need to do by testing it out on individual simulations.  Then use actions to 
set the graph parameters and double-check the settings.</p>
<p>A common mistake: If using the SPECIFIED or FRAUENFELDER analyses, the alignment
parameter is critical.  If the <i>add-silence-to-input-edges</i> action is called, 
this will affect the onset alignment of the input.  Use the <i>new-window</i> action
to get a complete picture of each simulation while setting up new scripts.
</p></li>
<li>Order of operations<p>The current version of scripting attempts to constrain 
the use of nodes, but there are many legal node combinations that result in 
undesirable effects, and some scripts that will cause jTRACE to have a
memory overload.  An example: An action inside an iterator will apply at every
iteration.  If the action need be applied only once, it is generally better to do 
so outside the iterator. 
</p></li>
<li>Time constraints<p>Obviously, the number of simulations in the script multiplies the
processing time.  As well, processing time depends very much on the machine running jTRACE.  
But, there are several parameters which have a particularly 
dramatic effect on processing time, and these are noted here.</p>  
<ul>
    <li>Lexicon size. A large lexicon will slow processing considerably.  Expect to
    notice significant delays around lexicon size = 1000.
    </li>
    <li>"Fraunfelder" analysis rule. Particularly complex calculations
    are required to compute the competitor set's activation in the modified Luce
    choice rule.</li>
    <li>Cycles-per-sim.  For normal single-word simulations, 66 cycles should be
    sufficient.  Very long simulations (cycles > 100) will increase running time.</li>
    <li>fslices.  This parameter, set to 66 by default, controls the number of total
    nodes in the model as well as the number of connections.  Like cycles-per-sim, 
    it should be kept as small as possible.</li>
</ul>
</p></li>
<li>Use the <i>write-to-a-file</i> action<p>This action is the cleanest way to
generate TXT file containing information about groups of simulations.  A single
call to this action writes one line of text to the file, with each argument 
seperated by a tab.  If the <i>decision-rule-report</i> query is not appropriate
to your application, use other queries in conjunction with <i>write-to-a-file</i>.</p></li>

<LI>basic lexical effect 2.jt (p.24): A word-initial ambiguous phoneme halfway 
    between /p/ and /k/ is dis-ambiguated once the model has boosted a target 
    word to a high level of activation.  In the Simulation tab, animate the sim 
    in order to see word and phoneme progress in parallel.</LI>
<LI>word-final lexical effect.jt (p.27): The lexical effect on phoneme 
    perception is most salient when the ambiguous phoneme occurs word 
    finally.</LI>
<LI>phoneme ambiguity.jt (p.28): The lexical effect on phoneme perception is 
    applied only to ambiguous phonological representations.  Unambiguous 
    representations activate their corresponding phoneme units, and any 
    lexical feedback effects are obscured by the strength of the bottom-up 
    signal.</LI>
<LI>reaction time effect 1.jt (p.30): The lexical effect on phoneme perception 
    is present only when the stimulus is a word (not a nonsense word) and is 
    stronger later in the word.  There is no lexical effect at the beginning of 
    a word because the item has not yet been identified as a word, so its 
    activation is minimal and cannot influence phoneme perception.  Part 1 shows 
    the positive case, where the target phoneme is (non)word-final.</LI>
<LI>reaction time effect 2.jt (p.30): Part 2 shows the negative case, where the 
    target phoneme is (non)word initial.</LI>
<LI>lexical conspiracy effect 1.jt (p.33): "Are phonotactic rule effects the result 
    of a conspiracy?" asks the heading on page 33.  Traditional phonotactic 
    probability theory suggests that the frequency of occurance sound patterns 
    in a language lead to expectations about sounds pattern in hearers of that 
    langauge.  These expectations, once established through experience, are 
    traditionally thought to be independant of lexical representations.  
    These simulations show that phnotactic probability effects could be the
    result of lexical feedback from words in the entire lexicon.  In part 1,
    with an ambiguous phoneme between /l/ and /r/,
    -s?i- primes /l/ because there are more "sli-" words in the slex lexicon;
    -t?i- primes /r/ because there are more "tri-" words in the lexicon.</LI>
<LI>lexical conspiracy effect 2.jt (p.33): simulation of /?luli/ (with a 
    continuum between /p/ and /t/), where the model eventually settles on the 
    word "truly", and thus /t/ comes to dominate /p/ as the initial phoneme.  
    This result is notable because phonotactically /pl/ is a more likely 
    sequence than /tr/; despite this /t/ come to dominate /p/ because the 
    most plausible lexical interpretation "truly" dominates and exerts its 
    influence on the phoneme level.</LI>
<LI>word recognition.jt (p.62): demonstrates TRACE recognizing a selection of words from the slex lexicon.</LI>
<LI>word segmentation.jt (p.63): "Lexical basis of word segmentation" suggests that the process of (1) recognizing 
    words is the basis for the process of (2) parsing a continuous sound into a sequence of 
    words.  "... When one word is identified, its identity can be used to determine where it ends and therefore where 
    the next word begins" (p.65).  For example, upon hearing /barti/, activation of "bar" suggests that the next word
    will begin after the /r/ sound, which would encourage activation of "tea".   Conversely, upon hearing
    /parti/ the word "party" would be activated and compete strongly with "tea", effectively ruling it out.
    For a two-word parse to be successful in that case, a pause between "par" and "tee" might be necessary 
    (ignoring for the moment possible syntactic or semantic contributions to segmentation).  The 4 simulations
    included in this example illustrate some of these principles; the figures may offer differing interpretations
    and investigators are encouraged to observe the sim animation, tweak graphing parameters, and refer to the
    text for further discussion of this important topic.</LI>
<LI>nonword boundaries.jt (p.65): The two simulations in this example touch upon several ideas.
    /pas^b^ltarg^t/ is an excellent case for the lexical segmentation : the long initial word 
    "possible" dominates early on, providing strong evidence for a word boundary after /l/.  
    This will help to segment that utterance.  In addition, if the model's task was to detect
    the phoneme /t/, doing so here would be facilitated by a cue to a word boundary (cf. Foss and
    Blank, 1980).  Contrast the second simulation: /piSd^rptarg^t/.  In this case the initial
    portion does not active a single strong candidate.  Therefore there is no reliable word
    boundary cue, and this does not lend support for activation of the /t/ following /piSd^rp/.
    Comparing the activation curve of /t/ in the two sims models the result of Foss & Blank 
    (1980), that subjects performance on detecting phonemes was faster when the target phoneme
    directly followed a word versus slower when the target directly followed a nonword.</LI>
<LI>short sentences.jt (p.69): These simulations provide further demonstation of word segmentation
    in TRACE.  In this case, sequences contain 2+ words.</LI>
<LI>your-gallery-item!.jt : By saving a simulation file to the jTRACE/gallery folder, your
    simulation will appear in the Gallery menu the next time you start jTRACE.

<LI><b>Lexical frequency</b> -  
Dahan et al (2001) implemented three types of lexical frequency effects in TRACE.
These were designed to fit eye-tracking data that demonstrated a clear lexical
frequency effect.  If you wish to affect a stronger or weaker frequency effect
than originally obtained, do so by tweaking the authors' original setting, given
below.
    <OL TYPE=a>
    <LI><b>frq resting levels</b><p> - Log frequency is applied to resting activation values
    of lexical units.  Value used by researchers to simulate frequency effect = 0.06.</p></LI>
    <LI><b>frq p->w wts</b><p> - Log frequency is applied to connections between phoneme and
    word units for each processing cycle.  This is a more "active" conceptualization of 
    frequency, versus the more "passive" approach represented by the resting levels implementation.  
    This implementation of frequency resulted in the closest fit to the eye-tracking data, see 
    Dahan et al. (2003).  Value used by researchers to simulate frequency effect = 0.13.</p></LI>
    <LI><b>frq post-act</b><p> - Log frequency is applied to Luce choice rule processing.
    This implementation is a post-perceptual approach to lexical frequency, in that frequency 
    is applied at the decision stage, rather than at the processing stage.  Said another way, 
    it is only when the system must make a decision that lexical frequency biases a listeners
    perception.  Value used by researchers to simulate frequency effect = 15.

<LI><b>Stochasticity</b><p> -  
McClelland (1991) implemented two types of stochasticity in TRACE in order to demonstrate
that context effects during phoneme perception occur in stochastic models as well as in
idealized models.   </p>
    <OL TYPE=a>
    <LI><b>Input noise</b><p> - Noise sampled from a Gaussian distribution is added to
    the pseudo-acoustic input representation, where the standard distribution of the 
    Gaussian function equals the value given in the parameter table.  The effect of
    input noise depends upon the min and max values given.  Assuming defaults of -0.3 
    and 1.0, respectively, then setting Noise SD to 1.0 adds a substantial amount of noise.
    </p></LI>
    <LI><b>Internal stochasticity</b><p> - Noise sampled from a Gaussian distribution
    is added to each node in each processing layer for each cycle.  This simulates noise 
    <i>inside</i> the system.  Stochasticity = 0.02 was the original value used, and 
    adds a substantial amount of input noise.

<LI><b>The Luce choice rule (LCR)</b>   
    <p> - All LCR functions are accessed in the graph panel, or are automated via scripting.
    Simply put, the Luce choice rule states that the probability of selecting (or responding
    to, or deciding on...) one item out of a set of items is equal to the (exponentially 
    scaled) strength of that item over the summed (exponentially-scaled) strength of all 
    items in the set.  This principle has proved highly useful in modeling a variety of 
    choice behavior (Luce, 1959). 
    When implementing it in TRACE, though, a number of tricky decisions must be made.</p>  
    <p> - The first decision is: considering that each phoneme and each word have multiple 
    copies of themselves arranged at different temporal alignments, how do we decide which
    of those alignments to use to represent that word/phoneme when calculating the LCR.
    We call this decision the calculation type.  Although the difference in results
    may be subtle from one type to the next, it is worthwhile to appreciate the theoretical
    commitment(s) being made at this step, which we will attempt to convey in the 
    description of each.</p> 
    <OL TYPE=i>
    <LI><b>Content type</b>
    <OL TYPE=a>
    <LI>Content type: Activations</b>
    <p> - Choosing to graph activations simply provides a line-graph of the same activation
    values observed in the simulation panel.  The advantage, of course, is the ability to
    directly compare specific items of interest from the phoneme and word domains.</p>
    </LI>
    <LI>Content type: Response Probabilities
    <p> - Choosing to graph responce probabilities </p> 
    </LI>
    </OL></LI>
    
    <LI><b>Alignment type</b>
    <OL TYPE=a>
    <LI><b>Alignment type: Specified</b>
    <p> 
     - The most straight-forward calculation type: an alignment value is supplied by
    the user.  Use the word/phoneme at that specified alignment to represent each item.
    This assumes that the system knows in advance the temporal alignment of the speech
    being presented.  In other words, a measure of omniscience is granted to the system. 
    Segmentation of continuous speech cannot be accomplished on  this definition because 
    only a single alignment is ever being considered at one time.  
    This type is used throughout the original TRACE paper (McClelland & Elman, 1986), whenever
    the LCR is used.  It is also the default type in the graph panel, mainly because 
    its results lend are easiest to interpret.
    </LI>
    <LI><b>Alignment type : Frauenfelder</b>
    <p> -  Frauenfelder & Peeters (1998) conducted a series of useful simulations,
    comparing TRACE's performance to recent experimental results.  They employed a
    unique calculation type whose aim was to encorporate lexical competition to a 
    large extent.  As in the specified calculation, the suer supplies an alignment.
    The numerator of the LCR function is then calcaulted as the response strength
    of the target item at the given aligned plus the response of the target item
    at given alignment + 1, i.e. one slot to the right.  The denominator of the
    LCR function is equal to all phoneme/word items that "overlap" with the given
    alignment.  This means that any item whose temporal extent coincides with the 
    given alignment is included in the denominator sum. Theoretically, this 
    calculation type is omniscient in the same way as the specified calculation; 
    in that it pre-supposes an alignment.  The implementation of competition is
    a useful innovation, certainly worthy of experimental attention.</p>
    </LI>
    <LI><b>Alignment type : Max (Post-hoc)</b> 
    <p> -  For each item, determine the alignment at which its peak activation
    is greatest, then use this alignment to represent that item.  This type
    is less omniscient than the formers because it does not presuppose a temporal 
    alignment.  The selected alignment for each item is encorporated into 
    the graph legend.
    This type performs lexical segmentation quite well, though
    fails if an item repeats, as in "dog eats dog".  This type has not been
    reported in literature that we know of.</p>
    <LI><b>Alignment type : Max (Ad-hoc)</b> 
    <p> -  For each item, determine the alignment at which its activation
    is greatest <i>for each processing cycle</i>; then use the 
    <i>alignment-per-item-per-cycle</i> as the representatives.  This 
    type is the least omniscient available.  This type has not been
    reported in literature that we know of.</p>    
    </LI>
    </OL></LI>
    <LI><b>Luce Denominator Parameter</b>
    <P> - Another decision to be made when setting up a LCR graph is normal choice 
    versus forced choice.  This setting can usually be left at normal.  
    The distinction being made here relates to what type of experimental design
    TRACE is attempting to model.  At the implementation level, this setting
    affects what items are to be included in the denominator of the LCR 
    calculation.</P>
    
    <OL TYPE=a>
    <LI><b>Choice: normal choice</b> 
    <p> -  If the task being modeled by TRACE has the subject considering all
    words in their lexicon or all phonemes in their phoneme roster, as per the
    case, then this is considered normal choice.  Such tasks include 
    perception of continuous speech, lexical decision, auditory naming, 
    word identification and phoneme identification.</p>    
    </LI>
    <LI><b>Choice: forced choice</b> 
    <p> -  If the task being modeled by TRACE forces the subject to choose
    from among a small set of words/phonemes, then this is considered forced
    choice.  For example, in the eye-tracking paradigm used by Dahan et al. 
    (2003) subjects saw four on-screen objects are were required to click
    on one based on an auditory instruction.  The researchers reasoned that 
    lexical activation is constrained by the fact that they must choose between
    four specific items.  To model this in TRACE</p>    
    </LI>
    </OL></LI>
    <LI><b>K-value (exponentiation)</b> 
    <p> - If content type is set to Responce Probabilities (instead 
    of activations), it is necessary to set the k-value.
    The K-value controls the magnitude of exponentiation applied to the 
    activation value.  The effect of a larger k value is to widen the gap
    between items that have an advantage and less active items.  Increasing
    k in steps of 2 and updating the graph illustrates this principle.  
    </P>
    <p>
    The value that results from this exponentiation
    is sometimes called <i>responce strength</i>.  These responce
    strengths are then passed through a version of the Luce choice rule, and the 
    result of that calculation is then called a <i>responce probability</i>.
    Sources may differ on how these stages of processing are named.</p>    
    </LI>    
    </OL>
</LI>
<LI><b>Length Normalization</b>   
    <p>The TRACE model has a built-in word length bias, which favors short words. 
    This is a by-product of the temporal representation of words.  Long words have
    more "sites of inhibition", i.e. more opportunities to be inhibited by other
    words.  With larger lexicons, it's possible that the length bias has undesirable
    effects on processing, potential obscuring TRACE's "true" behavior.  A simple
    form of length normalization has been implemented that can be turned on using
    this parameter. This is an experimental feature. Use and interpret at your own risk.</p>
    <p>How does length normalization work? 
        <ul>
            <li>If Inhib_T is the amount of inhibition being applied to target T, of length Len, then we transform Inhib_T as follows.</li>
            <li>avg_word_length is the mean word length in the current lexicon.</li>
            <li>ß = 1 / avg_word_length</li>
            <li>If (ß * Len > 1) then </li>
            <li>Then Normalize(Inhib_T) = Inhib_T / (ß * Len) </li>
            <li>Else (ß * Len <= 1) then</li>
            <li>Normalize(Inhib_T) = Inhib_T (i.e. no transformation)</li>
            <li>The Normalized() inhibition is applied instead of the regular inhibition</li>
        </ul>
